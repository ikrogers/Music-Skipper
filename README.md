# Music-Skipper

Basic app that skips songs of any player active in the background. Made this for resting my phone on treadmill while running as most default player buttons too small to hit while active.

TODO:
Make buttons size better
Make where screen does not shut off
Make where app diasbles ANY external media control output while active.
